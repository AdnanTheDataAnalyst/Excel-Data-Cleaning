# Welcome!

üëã Hello there! Welcome to my corner of the digital world. I'm Adnan, and I'm thrilled to have you here.

üîç As a dedicated data analyst, I've honed my skills in the art of deciphering the language of numbers and translating raw data into meaningful insights. One of my key strengths lies in my proficiency with Microsoft Excel, a tool I consider my data analysis companion.

## Excel Skills at a Glance:

### Data Cleaning and Transformation:

       - Then hit on any empty cell and type 'NA' and hit CTRL ENTER
   18. IFERROR
      - Problem: Under Profit Margin column where profit is divided by revenue, some rows have 'NA' which gives error sign
      - Solution:
          -In the cell, type =IFERROR(put the cells you want to divde and put coma.
          - After coma, type inside double quatation marks "NA".
