# Welcome!

üëã Hello there! Welcome to my corner of the digital world. I'm Adnan, and I'm thrilled to have you here.

üîç As a dedicated data analyst, I've honed my skills in the art of deciphering the language of numbers and translating raw data into meaningful insights. One of my key strengths lies in my proficiency with Microsoft Excel, a tool I consider my data analysis companion.

## Excel Skills at a Glance:

### Data Cleaning and Transformation:

   1. Autofit Rows and Columns
      - Problem: Long rows
      - Solution: Hit CTR + A, Go to Format and hit Autofit Row Height (or Use this ShortCut Alt + H + O + I) and Auto Fit Column Width (or Use this ShortCut Alt + H + O + 
   3. Find & Replace
      - Problem: Unnesscssay Info
      - Solution:
           - Remove unnessacay info within parathesis by selection the whole column and then going to Find & Select and choosing Replace tool (or Use this ShortCut CTRL + H).
           - To remove anything with the parathensis, type (*)
           - Hith Replace All. Hit ok, then hit close
   6. Lower & Upper
      - Problem: All text is Upper case which makes it hard to read
      - Solution:
           - Create new column by hitiing CTRL + Shift + Plus
           - Use this function '=LOWER', Then click on the cell you want to convert
           - To make changes on all rows in the same column, double click to drag down all the way to the buttom.
           - Before you delete the old column
